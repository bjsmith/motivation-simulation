#OK so...maybe here's how to model reward:
#the learning process simply modifies learning weights that tie each behavior to each appetite based on past
#changes
#one 'appetite' can be pleasure or fun-seeking but this is just one among several, which happens to have
#potentially strong postive (and negative) payoffs from just about everything.

#this still doesn't tell us how to model the anxious person who studies because they want to avoid failing...

#the core action tendency equation doesn't work well.
#we need some other way to integrate reward that
# - separates out reward and punishments.
# - shows how avoiding one thing (e.g., friends) could lead to other things (study)
# - and how that could lead to learning usefulness of study
# - try out a fifth aversive state, "mood" which is intrinsicially linked to all reward
# - or

#steve's questions:
# - How to do reinforcement leaning?
# - What to do with the cue*IS strength equation.
#       (might try just taking the reward system out entirely and see what we can get without it)
#       (also go back to notes)
#       Could also try ADDING cue*IS and reward, so that EITHER cue*IS OR reward is needed
#       alternatively cue*(IS | Reward), which could be accomplished by making Reward just another 'drive'
#       and then modeling it with associationist learning rather than simple reward-punishment learning
#       There are problems with both and we may need to separate intrinsic reward signal which is intrinsic with learning
#       from other ways of doing things.
#       ...Perhaps the Elicitor->State relationship should be subject to learning; this would be the mechanism which
#       keeps elicitors attached to reward without reward being explicitly modeled in the actionTendency model.

#Steve's answers:
#   - add a Action --> Cue system
#   - Focus on Elicitation, not Facilitation. Assume we always have Facilitation.
# random thought:


# - whatever solution we choose needs to reflect the idea that fulfillment of a more desperate need should lead to
# greater reward signal, and possibly to the extent that a need is only motivating if there's dopamine release on
# fulfilling it. (is that biologically accurate though? if wanting without liking is a thing then we wouldn't want to model this)



# - Depression?
# show how state and trait-level effects can lead to similar outcomes in any given situation

# should the elicitors be stimulating IS rather than multiplying by it? Possibly:
#   -for eating, there's a *physiological* state of hunger; this is then combined with an elicitor (food) to get an *interoceptive* state
#   which is then processed for actual decision-making.
#   - we really need to decide exactly what "Internal State" or "Interoceptive State" is: is it a pre-existing urge or something else?
